## SQLite Library Management System

A library management system project completed for the [Full Stack JavaScript Treehouse Techdegree](https://www.credential.net/324e3a8f-7283-4386-8d5b-187bc0488cb2). The project instructions were:

> You've been tasked with creating a library management system for a small library. The librarian has been using a simple sqlite database and has been entering data in manually. The librarian wants a more intuitive way to handle the library's books, patrons and loans.

> You'll be given static HTML designs, a set of requirements and the existing SQLite database. You'll be required to implement a dynamic website using Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.

## NewsCloud

An app that creates Word cloud comparisons of recent news headlines and summaries vs Twitter. Word clouds are based on the frequency of words found in the same headline, summary, or tweet as a specific search term. Data goes back 7 days and is restricted to the latest 100 headlines + summaries and tweets. A news ticker at the bottom of the page shows the 20 most recent searches, as well as the number of times these terms were searched.

NewsCloud was my capstone project for the [Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree](https://www.credential.net/324e3a8f-7283-4386-8d5b-187bc0488cb2).

## Markdown Previewer

A markdown previewer built as a project for the freeCodeCamp [Front End Libraries certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/rhvdbergh/front-end-libraries).

## Remove Numbers and Carriage Returns from Text

I needed to sanitize (ancient) Greek text by removing line numbers and carriage returns, but couldn't find a quick way to do it - so I created this online tool. Any text copied to the left box is stripped of numbers and carriage returns. The text on the right is immediately copied to the clipboard. Changes to the text on the right can be made on the fly (and the altered text is automatically copied to the clipboard.)

## Egreek Converter

A student had to convert several pages of Greek from the legacy font "Egreek" to Unicode characters. I wrote [a little utility](https://github.com/rhvdbergh/Greek-Converter) in Java to help.

## Perroquet's Deep Listening Service

I wanted to play with Google's speech-to-text API, so I created this chatbot. Google's API is experimental (or at least was at the time I built this bot), so Perroquet uses speech recognition only when on Google Chrome (Desktop).

## Animal Sounds Drumset

This farm animal "drum kit" was built with React as a project for the freeCodeCamp [Front End Libraries certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/rhvdbergh/front-end-libraries).

## Tic Tac Toe

A Tic Tac Toe game - either two player or single player. The single player uses a minimax algorithm and is, well, unbeatable. If you don't believe me, give it a try!

## Retro-themed Calculator

I gave this calculator, another freeCodeCamp project, a seventies look.

## Animated Pomodoro Clock 

This adjustable pomodoro clock was built with React as a freeCodeCamp project. It's animated using scalable vector graphics (SVG) ... and ends with a splat.
